This calculator uses fundamental Ember.js concepts such as models and components which generates a more organized and modern workflow compared to traditional Javascript.

The calculator buttons can be pressed just like a normal calculator.

The calculator supports consecutive arithmetic operations. If you wish to start a new equation, simply hit the "Reset" button (equivalent to AC on a traditional calculator) and start writing your new arithmetic equation!
